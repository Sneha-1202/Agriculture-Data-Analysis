# Agriculture-Data-Analysis

### Project Statement :

This project analyzes agricultural data to uncover insights that support smarter farming decisions. Data was stored and processed using AWS and Snowflake for scalable and efficient handling. Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards, highlighting trends in crop yield, weather patterns, and regional performance. The project demonstrates how cloud-based analytics can drive data-informed agriculture.

## Key Features Include

5. Data transformation using Snowflake SQL- adding rainfall groups column .
6. Importing data from Snowflake to Power BI and visualizing the data.

## Key Relationships Explored:

1. Rainfall Analysis: Assessed average rainfall across years, seasons, crop types, and geographic locations to identify patterns and anomalies. This helped understand how rainfall variability affects crop selection and productivity in different regions.

2. Temperature and Humidity Trends: Analyzed temperature and humidity fluctuations over time and locations to evaluate their influence on crop growth cycles. This provided insights into ideal climatic conditions for specific crops.

3. Crop Yield Analysis: Explored how environmental factors such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity correlate with crop yields. This analysis helped highlight conditions that contribute to higher or lower agricultural productivity, aiding better crop planning and risk management.
